# Scope

The Green Software Maturity Matrix is a self-assessment tool. It helps organisations understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems.

The matrix addresses four problems. It answers the questions:

* **"Where do I start?"** - for enterprises at level 1 of the GSMM, which tools and projects are available to help then achieve level 2
* **"Where am I now?"** - by using the checklists of the GSMM, enterprises can establish which level of the GSMM they are currently at for different axes
* **"What am I heading towards?"** - by establishing their current level, they can understand what is a realistic next milestone
* **"How do I know I am making progress?"** - by tracking their progress they can check they are not stuck


# Target Audience
* Enterprise CTOs and internal green advocates to guide their high-level journey and give them something to report progress against.
* Consultants offering green transition services.

# Solution

A simple maturity matrix with 5-6 levels of carbon efficiency and awareness in a poster-style diagram, together with a short guide. Training courses including those offered by the GSF, and standards such as the SCI & ISO can be overlaid.

# Objectives
* Get all GSF Members to start reporting (at least internally) on their GSMM scores and progress on a company or org unit basis.
* Provide high level context and a way into the other projects of the GSF including the TOSS project and the patterns 

# Deliverables
