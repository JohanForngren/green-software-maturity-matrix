# Scope

The matrix addresses four problems. It answers the questions:

* **"Where do I start?"** - for enterprises at level 1 of the GSMM, which tools and projects are available to help then achieve level 2
* **"Where am I now?"** - by using the checklists of the GSMM, enterprises can establish which level of the GSMM they are currently at for different axes
* **"What am I heading towards?"** - by establishing their current level, they can understand what is a realistic next milestone
* **"How do I know I am making progress?"** - by tracking their progress they can check they are not stuck


# Objectives
The objective is to get all GSF Members to start reporting (at least internally) on their GSMM scores and progress on a company or org unit basis.
