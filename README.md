# Green Software Maturity Matrix

The Green Software Maturity Matrix is a self-assessment tool. It helps organizations understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems.

This project is run through the [Community Working Group](https://grnsft.org/community-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

* "Where do I start?"
* "Where am I now?"
* "What am I heading towards?"
* "How do I know I am making progress?"
