# Level 2 - Aware

You know your organization's scope 1 and 2 emissions. You have a few projects using this data to drive greenness within and beyond your organization (by putting pressure on suppliers, for example). Your engineers have had some training in green systems, operations, and patterns.

| Axis      | State |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Whole organization energy commitments | Net carbon zero for scope 1, 2, and 3 by 2040 (note you may already be so-called "Carbon neutral") |
| Carbon footprint | You know what it is (scope 1 and 2) |
| CO2 equivalent metrics | Annual, quarterly, or monthly numbers from all suppliers (including outsourcers) and own systems for scope 1/2 |
| Server resource management | Occasional spring cleans where you manually turn off idle or low-value systems and delete/archive unneeded data |
| Energy resource management | Hosting in green regions/buying renewable energy |
| Minimize end-user device embodied carbon waste (assume circular economy) | Some ad-hoc targets in place |
| Minimize server hardware embodied carbon waste | Some ad-hoc systems and some systems using multi-tenancy to improve utilization |
| Product management | Carbon awareness part of product design |
| Education | Basic training for all engineers & PMs. Champions are trained |
